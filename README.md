# User Engagement 

Boosted a 75% app engagement among 1,200+ end-users and businesses with effective UX improvements and achieved a 81% user growth in under three months, expanding the user base from 550 to 1,000

## Context 

I knew that there was much more potential to be discovered on how to make the app more engaging. I also wanted to target businesses, which would also bring forth engagement from customers of those businesses...allowing us more users as well. So, my job was to discover more of what each user's ideal engagement is on the app and how we can allow businesses to benefit from our app. 

## Method 

The idea is to ideate new features for more engagement. I conducted contextual inquiry interviews to get background knowledge of why users are on the app in the first place. Find a possible root. By doing so, this process gave me a broad idea of our users. I also analyzed our users' time spent on the app throughout user database since we log those kinds of data. For businesses, I thought it would be a good idea to interview local businesses that was part of our Universities Farmer's Market. 

## Post Interviews and Insights

### My discovery led to 3 things: 

- Allowing users to be more engaging with their own profile means they want more personalization.  

- Users want engagement and connectedness with others more effectively. 

- Huge business partnership opportunies. 

### Quotes from users during contextual inquires: 

- "There's not much personalization from the app, especially for a platform that is meant to be a social media app. I want people to come across my profile and see more than just available handles that I have." 

- "As a local small business, it's hard to spread the word around about your business. It's also tough to showcase your business and its products efficiently. 

- "Outside of my close friends, it is hard to reach and connect with either mutuals or someone I just had become met with because I don't have a way to find their social media in one place." 

- "A lot of the time, connecting and networking with someone in the same club or org is hard. You would think it's easy because you can be in contact with each other. However, I have seen so many people in my club asking each other 'who's this person and what's this person @' even though they're all in the same circle.

## Results 

Achieved 81% user growth in under three months, expanding the user base from 550 to 1,000. This growth also included customers of businesses that became users of the app. Being partnered with our local businesses helped them and us grow. Our user base grew thanks to their customers, and their businesses flooded with visiting customers through the app. 

The addition of "Links" allowed businesses to direct their customers to different areas of their sites which was very efficient to them.

The addition of "Groups" as a new feature for users allowed clubs, professors, and residential halls to have a way of centralizing everyone into one group. Now anyone within that group can view other people's profile, making way more efficient to share one another's socials. And not to mention, more this adds more engagement to the app.

And the addition of "Soshi Bolts" offered users a way to keep on coming back to the app. This was a system the lets users gain more "Botls" the more friends they added.
